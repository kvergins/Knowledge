# Meditation

Mindfulness meditation isn’t about letting your thoughts wander. But it isn’t about trying to empty your mind, either. Instead, the practice involves paying close attention to the present moment — especially our own thoughts, emotions and sensations — whatever it is that’s happening.

Pick a time and make it like a habit. 

Just find a comfortable position where you can sit upright, and where you won’t be too distracted.
