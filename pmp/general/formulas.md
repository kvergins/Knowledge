# Formulas
- PV - The authorized budget assigned to scheduled work
- EV - The measure of work completed expressed in terms of the budget authorized for that work
- CV = EV − AC 
- SV = EV − PV 
- CPI = EV / AC
- SPI = EV / PV
- ETC = EAC − AC 
- - - -
- EAC = AC + BAC − EV - If all future ETC work will be accomplished at the budgeted rate
- EAC = BAC / CPI - If CPI achieved till now is expected to continue in the future 
- EAC = AC + buttom up ETC - If initial plan is no longer valid
- EAC = AC + ((BAC - EV) / (CPI * SPI)) - If ETC work will be performed at an efficiency rate that considers both the cost and schedule performance indices 
- - - -
- TCPI = (BAC - EV) / (BAC - AC)  - If there isn’t a new EAC value
- TCPI = (BAC - EV) / (EAC - AC)  - If there are a new EAC value 
- - - -
- VAC = BAC − EAC
- PV = FV / (1+r)^n
- FV = PV (1+r)^n
- PTA = [(ceiling price - target price) / buyers share] + target cost
