- *Motivation-Hygiene Theory* (Frederick Herzberg) -  Hygiene factors (Policies, Administration, Working conditions, Salary, Status, Supervision, Security) don’t motivate employees, motivation factors (Achievement, Recognition, Growth, Advancement, Interest in the job, Job challenge) does. 
- *Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs* - Theory states that human beings have basic needs and that people need to meet lower-level needs before they can move onto the next level of needs.

- *Expectancy Theory* (Victor Vroom) - Reward is being tied to performance, and ensuring that reward is what employee wants. It emphasises the links between behaviour, rewards, and the organisation’s goals.
- Joseph Juran. He was one of a number of management theorists who worked in Japan in the 1950s. Juran defined quality as “fitness for use”: “An essential requirement of these products is that they meet the needs of those members of society who will actually use them. This concept of fitness for use is universal. It applies to all goods and services, without exception. The popular term for fitness for use is Quality, and our basic definition becomes: quality means fitness for use.”
