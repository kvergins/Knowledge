# Things to Remember 

## Organisation types
![](things-to-remember/PMP%20knowledge%20base.jpeg)

## PMO types
* Supportive
	* Low control, provides all the necessary OPA needed for the project
* Controlling
	* Moderate control, provides all the necessary OPA needed for the project, *but does some control on result*
* Directive
	* High control, project managers write reports and run by work with PMO

## Types of project endings
* Extinction: type of project ending that occurs when the project is completed and accepted by the stakeholders
* Starvation: type of project ending where resources are cut off from the project
* Integration: type of project ending where the resources of the project are reassigned to other projects or other activities within the organization
* Addition: type of project ending that occurs when projects evolve into ongoing operations

## Conflict Resolution Techniques
* Withdraw/Avoid
	* If stakes are low, conflict aren’t important or it can resolve by itself
* Smooth/Accommodate
	* Temporary solution to a problem 
* Compromise/Reconcile
	* Solution partly satisfies both parties
* Force/Direct
	* You agree to one party’s viewpoint and enforce their wishes
* Collaborate/Problem Solve
	* You find a solution all parties agree on

## Work performance data, information, reports
* *Work performance data* - Raw data, that is gathered trough project management activities performed to carry out project work. Percent of completed work, start and end dates of performed activities, number of change requests, number of defects etc. Usually recorded in project management information system (PMIS).
* *Work performance information* -  Data collected form various controlling processes, analysed in context and integrated based on context across areas. Status of deliverables, estimate to completion, resources needed to complete etc.
* *Work performance reports* - Physical or electronic representation that compiles work performance information, which is intended to generate discussions or rise issues, actions, or awareness. Presentations, reports, memos, dashboards etc.    

## PMP dependency types
* *Mandatory (hard logic)* - Activity that is legally or constructionally required to ensure further activities. Get approval of requirements document, start development; build car prototype, perform crash test.
* *Discretionary (soft logic)* - There are many paths to perform activities, team can decide the sequence. Book airline ticket, buy insurance; furnish room A, furnish room B.
* *External* - Activities that are performed outside project team, but project depends on. Deliver equipment, start development.
* *Internal* - Activities that are performed by project team. Construct wall, paint wall.  

## Project Selection Methods
• *Benefit Measurement Method* - Projects are chosen and maintained with a sustained focus on benefits and present value of investment. Benefits are measured and tracked trough project life cycle. 
• *Constrained Optimization Method* - You compare different projects based on complex mathematical calculations, various worst and best case scenarios and outcomes, at the end choosing one most compatible for execution. This method usually are used regarding large projects.  

## Quality assurance vs quality control
• *Quality assurance* - Activities to ensure that you develop an error free product. 
• *Quality control* - Check if developed product works as planned. If any defects are detected, you should fix it before the end of the project. 

## Project lifecycle approaches
* *Predictive* - Waterfall
* *Iterative* - 2-4 month long iterations. Basically Waterfall approach divided in bunch of cycles to provide more flexibility for changes. 
* *Incremental* - Similar as iterative, but multiple functionalities (increments) can be developed at the same time.
* *Adaptive* - Agile. Short iterations, reduced risk of inherent. Used if result is needed fast. 
* *Hybrid* - Combines best approaches of all. 

- EMV analysis
	- Expected monetary value (EMV) is a statistical technique in risk management that is used to quantify the risks, which in turn, assists the project manager to calculate the contingency reserve.
	- Expected Monetary Value (EMV) = Probability * Impact
