…the process of managing procurement relationships; monitoring contract performance, and making changes and corrections as appropriate; and closing out contracts 

- Monitors and controls both buyer and seller’s contractual performance 
- Both seller and buyer undertake procurement control activities 
- Help ensure all agreed work is being completed in alignment with contractual conditions 
- Reduces project’s risk exposure from procurement activities 
- Performance reviews & inspections are key tools 
- Changes in contract allowed, given agreement from all involved parties 
- Contract may be terminated if seller performance becomes a concern or other issues arise 
- Contract administration often handled by a specialty department outside of the project team
