- Occurs alongside project work, risk analysis and risk planning

- Determines if risks have changed, new risks have emerged, or if risks have passed by 
- Ensures risk policies are followed and effective 
- Questions project assumptions and viability of contingency reserves 

- Are risk policies being followed? 
- Are risk policies effective? 
- Are contingency reserves in line with needs and expected risks? 
- Are project assumptions still valid?
