# Perform Integrated Change Control

…the process of reviewing all change requests; approving changes and managing changes…and communicating the decisions 

- Approves and manages changes to deliverables, project requirements and project documents 
- Handles changes in a unified way that helps avoid unintended consequences and new risks 
- Continuous for whole project
- Change requests should be **approved** or **rejected**
- Any stakeholder may request a change 
- Change requests may begin verbally but should be formally written up and submitted before consideration 
- Requests typically approved by **project manager**or **project sponsor**
- Approval source will be identified in organization’s rules or project management plan 
- Larger projects may provision a **change control board**, formally chartered to handle all change topics 
- Impact of change on activity sequences, cost, schedule, resource requirements and risk
