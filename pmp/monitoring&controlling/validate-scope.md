# Validate Scope

â€¦the process of formalizing acceptance of the completed project deliverables 

- Uses previously agreed upon metrics to judge if deliverable matches requirements

- Increases odds of successful delivery or fulfillment of agreement 
- Process is preceded by creation of the Scope Baseline in previous processes
- The Control Quality process focuses on verifying deliverables are correct 
- The Validate Scope process focuses on getting deliverables approve 
- Validated deliverables become **accepted** deliverables, passed to Close Project or Phase
