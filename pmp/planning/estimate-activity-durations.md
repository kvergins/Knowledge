# Estimate Activity Durations

â€¦the process of estimating the number of work periods needed to complete individual activities with estimated resources. 

- Adds a time component to resource estimates 
- Works hand in hand with Project Resource Management process Estimate Activity Resources 
- Each equally critical to developing the project schedule 
- Uniform units are more easily aggregated, reported and understood 
- Durations should be standardized in format and unit of measure when possible 
- Duration estimates should be progressively elaborated 
- Consider adding more cushion when dealing with less experience or less information 
- **Analogous Estimating** creates projections based on similar work in the past 
- **Parametric Estimating** creates projections by using formulas that harness historical data 
- **Three Point Estimating** creates optimistic, pessimistic and most-likely projections and suggests a reasonable middle-ground 
- **Contingency Reserves** tackle known risks that may arise during a project 
- **Management Reserves** tackle unknown risks that may arise during a project
