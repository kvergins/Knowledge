â€¦the process of estimating team resources and the type and quantities of materials, equipment, and supplies necessary to perform project work. 

- Outlines the types, quantities and attributes of resources required to accomplish project activities 
- Closely tied to other processes, especially Estimate Costs, Estimate Activity Durations and Develop Schedule 
- Estimations should be made using standardized units when possible 
- Project constraints may influence which resources are utilized 
- **Resource Calendars** identify when resources are in use or available 
- **Resource Breakdown Structures** sort project resources graphically by type and category 
- **Bottom-up Estimating** aggregates duration or cost estimates beginning at the activity level
