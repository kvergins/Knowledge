# Estimate Costs

…the process of developing an approximation of the cost of resources needed to complete project work. 

- How much will project work cost to complete? 
- How much money must be applied toward each activity? 
- How will projects be financed? 
- How will financing be timed? 

- Based on information known at time of estimation 
- Information gathered from other knowledge areas’ outputs 
- Estimation techniques often similar to those used for scheduling 

- **Rough Order of Magnitude: -25% to +75% range**
- **Definitive Estimates: -5% to +10% range**

- **Analogous Estimating:** Basing estimates on similar historical experiences 
- **Parametric Estimating:** Developing formulas that use historical data to generate estimates 
- **Three-point Estimating:** Generating pessimistic, optimistic and most likely scenarios based on historical data 
- **Ground-up Estimating:** Building aggregated estimates at higher levels based on activity or work package-level estimates
