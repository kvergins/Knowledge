# Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis

â€¦the process of prioritizing individual risks for further analysis or action by assessing their probability of occurrence and impact as well as other characteristics. 

- Puts risks in perspective by comparing them with each other and predicting their effects on the project 
- Use of common definitions of impact and probability can reduce potential for bias 
- Cost, quality, schedule and scope are among the factors used to rate risks
- Consider risk event timing 
- Factor in availability of information about risk event 
- Can be completed quickly and at low cost 
- Not meant to be a comprehensive analysis 
- Guides risk planning and quantitative risk analysis 
- Performed throughout project 

- **Probability:** How likely a risk is to transpire
- **Impact:** How great an effect a risk may have if it occurs 
- **Risk ratings:** Developed by multiplying probability and impact, often tweaked to account for urgency 
- **Probability and impact matrix:** Used to visualize and prioritize project risks with varying attributes
