# Plan Communications Management

â€¦the process of developing an appropriate approach and plan for project communications activities based on the information needs of each stakeholder or group, available organizational assets, and the needs of the project. 

- Ensures information is properly disseminated during project 
- Right message, right format, right recipients, right timing 
- Needs vary widely by project, phase, activity and stakeholder
- Different styles, modes, and contents of communications are needed for different scenarios, activities and stakeholders 
- Who, when, where, what and why provide helpful context, as does an understanding of cultural and geographic factors
- **Standard model:** Encode * Transmit * Decode * Acknowledge * Response 
- **Scaling:** Channels = **n(n-1)/2**, n = # of stakeholders 
- **Noise:** Differences in expertise, language, cultures, technology factors and context can all add noise to messages, corrupting/disrupting their meaning
