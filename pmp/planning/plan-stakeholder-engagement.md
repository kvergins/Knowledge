# Plan Stakeholder Engagement

â€¦the process of developing approaches to involve project stakeholders based on their needs, expectations, interests, and potential impact on the project. 

- Project influences stakeholders, and vice versa 
- Each point of influence is an opportunity for engagement 
- Opportunities may be used to activate stakeholders, manage expectations, and achieve project objectives 

### Optimal Engagement Levels
- May vary by stakeholder **and**by project phase 
- Often, senior management may be more engaged early in project, handing reins over to project workers and end users as project work progresses 
- Level of influence, interest and involvement may impact appropriate level of engagement 
- Stakeholders may take leading, supporting, neutral, or resistant positions, or may remain unaware of the project and its impacts 
- Stakeholder engagement assessment matrix helpful in visualizing current and desired engagement level 

### Stakeholder Management Plan
- Outlines how engagement will be managed throughout project 
- Must be reviewed often as stakeholders enter and leave project environment and stakeholder relationships evolve
