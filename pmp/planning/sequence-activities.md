# Sequence Activities

…the process of identifying and documenting relationships among the project activities. 

- Charting correct workflow nearly as important as determining scope and activity list 
- Determines how work *must*or *should*be done in order to meet project objectives 
- Maximizes project efficiency and effectiveness 
- All but first and last project activities have predecessors and successors 
- Relationship between activities may be mandatory or discretionary in nature 
- Logical relationships dictate when activities begin and end relative to others 

- **Lead–** Amount of time an activity may be moved up to begin closer to or alongside predecessor 
- **Lag–** Amount of time that must pass until a successor activity may begin
