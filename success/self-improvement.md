# Self Improvement 

To achieve your biggest and most ambitious goals, just break it down to small, doable tasks and crack theses one by one. Try to improve your daily routine, e.g., if you spend your time driving our walking to work every day, listen to some audio guide to learn a new language. You must control your actions and know when you are doing unproductive stuff to switch to something productive.

## Daily Checklist

- Exercise (strength training, running, sports, yoga, etc.)
- Clean diet. No garbage, processed food. Eat naturally. Lean meat, veggies, some fruit. No fast-food, no bullshit. Health body leads to healthy mind.
- Sleep on time and sleep enough, ideally 8 hours every night.
- [Meditate](/meditation/meditation.md) every morning for at least 10 minutes. Try Calm or Headspace app. 
- Practice what you suck at. Every day. Practice, practice, practice. I want you to fail over and over again, get back up, and fight again. Warrior mentality.
- Write in a journal everyday to plan tasks and track progress. Identify problems along the way that should be solved.
- Quit all social media and anything else that gives your brain dopamine hits. Remove all addictions from your life. Itâ€™s wasting precious time you could spend improving yourself.
