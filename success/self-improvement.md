# Self Improvement 

To achieve your biggest and most ambitious goals, just break it down to small, doable tasks and crack theses one by one. Try to improve your daily routine, e.g., if you spend your time driving our walking to work every day, listen to some audio guide to learn a new language. You must control your actions and know when you are doing unproductive stuff to switch to something productive.

## Daily Checklist

- Exercise (strength training, running, sports, yoga, etc.)
- Clean diet. No garbage, processed food. Eat naturally. Lean meat, veggies, some fruit. No fast-food, no bullshit. Health body leads to healthy mind.
- Sleep on time and sleep enough, ideally 8 hours every night.
- [Meditate](/meditation/meditation.md) every morning for at least 10 minutes. Try Calm or Headspace app. 
- Practice what you suck at. Every day. Practice, practice, practice. I want you to fail over and over again, get back up, and fight again. Warrior mentality.
- Write in a journal everyday to plan tasks and track progress. Identify problems along the way that should be solved.
- Quit all social media and anything else that gives your brain dopamine hits. Remove all addictions from your life. It’s wasting precious time you could spend improving yourself.

## Become Outlier

- **Compound yourself.** Compounding is magic. Look for it everywhere. Exponential curves are the key to wealth generation. 
- **Have self-belief.** Self-belief is immensely powerful. The most successful people I know believe in themselves almost to the point of delusion.
- **Learn to think independently.** “*I will fail many times, and I will be really right once*” is the entrepreneurs’ way. You have to give yourself a lot of chances to get lucky.
- **Be good at sales.** Self-belief alone is not sufficient—you also have to be able to convince other people of what you believe.
- **Make it easy to take risks.** Most people overestimate risk and underestimate reward. Taking risks is important because it’s impossible to be right all the time—you have to try many things and adapt quickly as you learn more.
- **Focus.** Most people waste most of their time on stuff that doesn’t matter.
- **Work hard.** Extreme people get extreme results.
- **Be bold.** Follow your curiosity. Things that seem exciting to you will often seem exciting to other people too.
- **Be willful.** A combination of self-doubt, giving up too early, and not pushing hard enough prevents most people from ever reaching anywhere near their potential.
- **Be hard to compete with.** If what you do can be done by someone else, it eventually will be, and for less money.
- **Build a network.** An effective way to build a network is to help people as much as you can.
- **You get rich by owning things.** You get truly rich by owning things that increase rapidly in value. 
- **Be internally driven.** Most people are primarily externally driven; they do what they do because they want to impress other people. Impress yourself.
